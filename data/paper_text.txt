SECTION 4.1: DATASET STATISTICS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We collected 37 merged pull requests from 4 actively 
maintained Python repositories on GitHub. Our dataset contains 190 
human review comments, with an average of 5.1 reviews per pull 
request. This is notably higher than typical open-source projects (2-3 
reviews per PR), indicating high-quality, thoroughly reviewed code. The 
pull requests encompass 5,096 lines of code changes, with an 
average of 138 lines per PR, representing realistic development 
tasks that are neither trivially small nor unmanageably large.

Our dataset captures two types of code review feedback: (1) inline 
comments (144 instances, 75.8%), which provide specific, 
line-level suggestions on code implementation, and (2) general review 
summaries (46 instances, 24.2%), which offer overall assessment 
and approval status. This distribution reflects authentic code review 
practices where reviewers provide both detailed technical feedback and 
high-level evaluations. Table~\ref{tab:dataset_stats} shows the 
distribution of pull requests across repositories.

KEY FINDINGS TO EMPHASIZE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
• High review engagement: 5.1 reviews/PR (vs. 2-3 typical)
• Comprehensive coverage: 4 diverse repositories
• Balanced review types: 76% inline, 24% general
• Realistic scope: 138 LOC/PR average
